# Progress Report - November 23, 2025

## Project: JamieWatters.work

### ✅ Completed

- **Implemented GitHub-based progress file fetching** - Updated the Progress Report Generator to fetch `/progress/` files directly from GitHub repositories instead of local filesystem. This enables the full workflow where `/dailyreport` runs in any project repo and the admin panel pulls files via GitHub API.

- **Added `listDirectoryFromGitHub()` utility function** - New function in `lib/github.ts` that lists files in a repository directory via GitHub API, with graceful 404 handling for directories that don't exist yet.

- **Rewrote list-progress-files API** - Complete rewrite of `/api/admin/content/list-progress-files` to fetch projects with `trackProgress: true` from database and list their `/progress/` directories via GitHub.

- **Rewrote generate-from-progress API** - Updated `/api/admin/content/generate-from-progress` to accept `projectId` and `repoPath`, fetching file content from GitHub using each project's stored token.

- **Updated ProgressReportGenerator component** - Enhanced the admin UI to group progress files by project name, use new API parameters, and show project/filename in selection interface.

### 🐛 Issues & Learnings

No blocking issues encountered during this session. The implementation followed established patterns from the existing Daily Update Generator.

**Learning**: The existing GitHub integration patterns (`parseGitHubUrl`, `fetchFileFromGitHub`, token decryption) made adding directory listing straightforward. Consistency in the codebase pays off.

## Impact Summary

Completed the GitHub integration for the Progress Report Generator, enabling the intended multi-project workflow. Users can now run `/dailyreport` in any tracked project repository, and the admin panel will automatically discover and list those files for blog post generation. This removes the previous limitation of requiring local filesystem access.

## Next Steps

- Browser test the complete flow with a real progress file from GitHub
- Ensure at least one project has `trackProgress: true` configured with a valid GitHub URL
- Create a progress file in a test project to verify end-to-end functionality
