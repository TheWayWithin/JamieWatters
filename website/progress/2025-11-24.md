# Progress Report - November 24, 2025

## Project: JamieWatters.work

### ✅ Completed

- **Updated Journey section with honest milestones** - Replaced fake revenue metrics with real building progress. Changed from aspirational "$1K MRR" goals to authentic "10+ projects in 6 months, zero revenue yet" story.

- **Rewrote achievements timeline** - Created honest 6-month timeline from May 2025 (first project: FreeCalcHub) through November 2025 (JamieWatters.work launch). Documented real pivots and learnings.

- **Updated next milestone to "First Dollar of Revenue"** - Changed focus from fake scaling metrics to authentic first customer acquisition goal. Honest about shift from building to marketing.

### 🐛 Issues & Learnings

No issues encountered. This was a content update session focused on authenticity.

**Learning**: Being honest about zero revenue while showing massive execution velocity is more compelling than fake metrics. Most founders fake their numbers - showing real builder progress is differentiation.

## Impact Summary

Transformed the Journey section from aspirational fiction to authentic build-in-public documentation. The honest story (zero coding experience → 10+ projects in 6 months → zero revenue but massive momentum) is way more inspiring than fake customer numbers. This aligns the site with the actual journey and sets up the next phase: first dollar of revenue.

## Next Steps

- Deploy changes to production via Netlify
- Verify the updated Journey section displays correctly
- Focus on marketing and validation for first revenue
