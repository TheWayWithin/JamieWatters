# JamieWatters Portfolio - 2025-11-21 Progress Report

## Completed Today

- [x] Implemented Progress Report Generator backend infrastructure
- [x] Created progress-parser.ts to parse daily progress markdown files
- [x] Created progress-report-generator.ts to transform parsed data into blog content
- [x] Built API endpoints for generating and listing progress files
- [x] Created ProgressReportGenerator.tsx frontend component
- [x] Integrated component into admin content page

## Issues & Learnings

### Issue: API Authentication Pattern Mismatch
- **Symptom**: Initial API routes used Supabase auth pattern which doesn't exist in project
- **Root Cause**: Developer template assumed Supabase auth, but project uses custom JWT auth
- **Fix**: Updated API routes to use verifyToken and extractTokenFromRequest from @/lib/auth
- **Learning**: Always check existing auth patterns in similar API routes before implementing new ones

### Issue: Component Directory Location Confusion
- **Symptom**: Task tool created component in wrong directory path
- **Root Cause**: Project has nested website/ subdirectory structure that wasn't clear
- **Fix**: Verified correct path and created component in website/components/admin/
- **Learning**: Always verify actual project structure before file operations

## Impact Summary

The Progress Report Generator feature is now complete. Users can select daily progress files from the admin UI, choose between full post or quick summary format, and generate blog-ready content with authentic "build in public" content including challenges and learnings. This significantly enhances the content workflow by providing curated, high-quality posts instead of raw task lists.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test the full end-to-end flow in the browser
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Test with various progress file formats
- [ ] Add more sample progress files for testing different scenarios
