    content: `# Week 1: Building JamieWatters.work

The journey begins. This week marks the start of documenting my path from zero to building a billion-dollar portfolio of AI-powered SaaS productsâ€”completely solo.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public isn't just about transparency. It's about accountability, learning, and connecting with others on similar journeys. By sharing everythingâ€”successes, failures, metrics, and decisionsâ€”I'm creating a resource for aspiring solopreneurs.

## What I'm Building

JamieWatters.work is more than a portfolio site. It's:
- A transparent view into my 10+ active projects
- Real metrics and honest updates
- A platform to share frameworks and learnings
- Proof that one person can build something massive

## This Week's Progress

- âœ… Completed strategic analysis with AI agents
- âœ… Finalized technical architecture (Next.js + Neon + Netlify)
- âœ… Designed complete UI/UX system
- ðŸš§ Started implementation (currently in progress)

## Next Steps

Phase 4 continues with building out the home page, portfolio pages, and blog system. The goal is to launch the MVP within 4-6 weeks and start sharing weekly updates.

Stay tuned for Week 2 updates!`,

    excerpt: "Why I chose Next.js, Neon, and Netlify for my personal brand website. A practical guide to making technology decisions as a solo founder.",
    content: `# Choosing the Right Tech Stack for Solo Founders in 2025

Technology decisions can make or break a solo project. Here's how I chose my stack and what I learned in the process.

## The Framework Decision: Next.js

After evaluating Astro, Remix, and plain React, I chose Next.js 14 with App Router because:
- **Performance**: Built-in ISR and edge caching
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and conventions
- **Ecosystem**: Massive community and plugin ecosystem
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering and static generation out of the box

## Database: Neon over Supabase

While Supabase is popular, I chose Neon for:
- **Branch databases**: Git-like branching for preview deployments
- **Serverless**: Pay-per-use with built-in connection pooling
- **Simplicity**: Just Postgres, no extra features I don't need yet
- **Developer experience**: Instant provisioning and great CLI

## Deployment: Netlify vs Vercel

Both are excellent, but Netlify won because:
- **Branch deploys**: Automatic preview deployments
- **Build plugins**: Flexibility for custom build steps
- **Pricing**: Better free tier for getting started

## Lessons Learned

1. **Choose boring technology**: Next.js and Postgres are proven
2. **Optimize for solo speed**: Avoid complex setups
3. **Start simple**: Can always add complexity later

Ship fast, iterate based on real usage.`,

    excerpt: "How I use AGENT-11 to orchestrate development with specialized AI agents. A practical guide to AI-assisted development in 2025.",
    content: `# Using AI Agents to 10x Your Development Workflow

AI agents aren't just for chatbots. They're now essential tools for solo developers who want to move fast and ship quality products.

## What is AGENT-11?

AGENT-11 is a framework I built for deploying specialized AI agents in Claude Code. It includes:
- The Strategist (product strategy)
- The Architect (system design)
- The Designer (UI/UX)
- The Developer (implementation)
- The Tester (quality assurance)
- The Operator (DevOps)
- ...and 5 more specialized roles

## Real Results

Building JamieWatters.work with AGENT-11:
- **Strategic analysis**: 2 hours (vs 2 days manually)
- **Architecture design**: 3 hours (vs 1 week manually)
- **UI/UX design**: 4 hours (vs 2 weeks with designer)
- **Implementation**: In progress (estimated 50% faster)

## How It Works

Each agent is a specialized Claude instance with:
1. Specific role and capabilities
2. Access to relevant tools (code, database, deployment)
3. Context preservation between handoffs
4. Clear delegation protocols

The Coordinator orchestrates multi-agent workflows, ensuring zero context loss and efficient collaboration.

## Key Takeaways

- AI agents can handle 80% of routine development tasks
- Critical thinking still requires human oversight
- Context preservation is essential for quality
- Specialized agents > generalist chatbots
