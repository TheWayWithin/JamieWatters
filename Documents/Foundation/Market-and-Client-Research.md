- Barriers to Entry:
  1. Building authentic credibility (requires proof through building)
  2. Community trust (takes time and transparency)
  3. Product development capability (AI significantly lowers this)
  4. Thought leadership positioning (build-in-public accelerates this)

### Indirect Competitors and Alternatives

**Alternative Solutions:**
1. **DIY/Manual Approaches:** Spreadsheets, manual processes, trial-and-error learning
2. **Substitute Products:** General business education (MasterClass, Coursera), generic automation tools (Zapier, Make)
